		<h2>What is a <q>Trunk or Treat?</q></h2>
		<p>
			This is a fun event geared towards all ages. It is usually set up in a large parking lot. People volunteer to decorate the trunks of their car, and give out candy to the kids attending the event. Kids and adults alike can celebrate Halloween with this fun family event. Come and enjoy a lot of candy, fun, family time, and games! This is a great alternative to Trick or Treating if you don't live in a neighborhood, or don't have one near you. Bring your favorite Halloween costume, and get ready for your new Halloween tradition, <b>all for completely free!</b> 
		</p>
		<h2>How do I participate?</h2>
		<p>
 			There are two different ways you can participate in the event:
		</p>
		<h3><b>1. Decorate your car</b></h3>
		<p>
			Adults can volunteer to decorate the trunks of their cars, and give out candy and prizes to the kids. You can get as creative as you want with this by adding games, obstacle courses, and interactive decorations. Games such as ring toss, pin the tail on the donkey, and bobbing for apples are easy, and great options for exciting games. You can decorate your trunk with a theme like Charlie Brown, a haunted house, a pumpkin patch, and any other fall and Halloween themes that you can think of! <b>You</b> can be a part of making this event a lifelong memory.
		</p>
		<h3><b>2. Dress up and enjoy!</b></h3>
		<p>
			Another way to enjoy this event is to dress up and take part in the fun! You can dress up as your favorite animal, a book or movie character, a favorite superhero, and anything else you can think of! The sky is the limit, you can buy a costume, or use your creativity and make your own costume from scratch! This is a lot like Trick or Treating. You walk around to the different decorated cars, and usually complete a game to get your candy reward. Invite your friends, and family members to this Halloween celebration. Your goal should be to have the best Halloween celebration yet!
